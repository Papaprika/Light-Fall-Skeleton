		<h1>The First Sound</h1>
			<p> The first sound you hear when you awake is the steady drip of a water droplet ploping into a small puddle of water. Or at least you assume its a small puddle because you <i>can't see anything!</i> Pitch black darkness surrounds you. </p>

				 	You feel yourself sitting on a hard cool floor. You take a moment to gather your thoughts and wait for your vision to adjust to your new setting. It isn't unusual for you to sleep in the dark but something about this kind seems ominous. You can feel the moisture in the air and realize it must be damp in here. Where is "<i>here</i>" anyway? Last you remember you went to bed... This can't be a kidnapping, can it? You don't feel like you were someone worth getting a ransom from.
				</p>

				<p>
				 	As you regain more vision you realize, with relief, you are alone at least. The surroundings seem to be an old ruin or dungeon room. Worn bricks clutter the walls and floor. The ceiling seems to be adorned with a medieval-style chandelier...with all the candles blown out, great. On the wall, you spot an unlit stick torch with...an <i>old-fashioned flint spark lighter!</i> Looks like your luck isn't all bad you think to yourself. You lift from the floor, make your way over to the torch and lighter, and light it; defeating the ominous darkness in the room. 
				</p>

				<p>
				 	After, celebrating your victory of the day in your head you begin checking yourself. You seemed to be covered in "bandage-like" rags of some sort from head to toe. It's raggedy but it feels very comfortable on you. But you weren't wearing this before... Strange. Before you to the west lives a small puddle, presumably the one that woke you in the first place. A drop of water falls from the ceiling of the room above into the puddle below, creating a slow metronome effect with its sound. To the north next to the place you were sitting appears to be a small wall fountain. It's decorated with a beautiful Koi Fish statue with a hole where the mouth is but no water coming out. There is some water in the bowl of the fountain, however. You could look into it. Maybe you could use it as a vanity mirror. Or drink from it? <i>Ew</i> The thought makes you cringe. Next to the fountain and northwest corner Is a hole in the wall about half your size, which seems to be the only exit to the room. You could duck through it and use it to escape this room.

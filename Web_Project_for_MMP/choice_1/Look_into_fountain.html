		<h1>You Peer Into The Water</h1>

			<p>
				You decide to take a look into the water of the fountain. You walk over, with torch in hand, and begin to bend over the waist-high bowl of the wall fountain. Using the torch as a light source you look at your face in the water of the bowel. You are shocked to see a <i>skelenton</i> staring right back at you! You gasp and retreat back, almost losing your balance in the process. No, this can't be! You <i>CAN'T</i> be a skeleton! You <i>CAN'T</i> be <i>DEAD!</i> You try to scream but can't! With no vocal cords or lungs, you can't make a sound. You are panicking so hard that if you had a heart right now, you would've died twice. HOW?! How can this be?! WHEN?! WHY?!  Maybe you are dreaming? You think to yourself in a moment of desperation, if you die in a dream then maybe you could wake up. You could use the fire from the torch and wake up from this nightmare!

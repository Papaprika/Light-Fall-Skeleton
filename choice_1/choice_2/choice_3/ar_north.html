					<h1>
						Head To The North
					</h1>
							<p>
								You decide to steel your nerves and head toward the tall doors towards the north. Each footstep requires more courage than the last, but you grip your flame stick and carry forward. You finally reach the door after what feels like an eternity of walking, and the sound beyond the door becomes clear than before. It sounds like fighting on the other side of the door. Caution grips hold of you as slowly crack open the door and peek through it. You see a man and a pile of dead monsters on the ground. He is covered in sweat and blue monster blood. It appears as though a very intense battle is just finishing up as the man slays the last monster you can see. He looks worn and weak even before you notice an obvious fatal-looking wound in his torso. He warps it up by tearing off the sleeves of his shirt and using it as a makeshift bandage. You don't think there is anything you can do for him now even if you were the best surgeon around. He laughs and acts as though he is unfazed by the situation. You consider being with him in his final moments to at least offer some comfort. Just because you are all bones doesn't mean you are heartless. As you consider this the man turns to face the door.

								Your heart(?) races as you think he might've spotted you, but he smiles and says " You are safe now, I got all the bad monsters." His voice is oddly rough so it's weird that he is trying to sound as non-threatening as possible. A little girl suddenly comes into view from the right of your blocked vision. She must've been <i>hiding near the door you are peeking from!</i>  She looks scared and sad as she takes in the older man's image. The man follows her gaze to the bandaged wound. "Oh! This!? It's nothing really. Just a little bit of sleep and I'll be right as rain. I promise!" With his hands on his hips, and head thrown back, he gives a hardy laugh. Maybe to hide the pain or his face so she won't worry. "Go on through those doors and you should be able to find a way out." The man says after he composes himself. "I already checked and there should be no monsters in there. According to the legends about this place, there should be a secret escape route that the old ruler used to get out during the downfall of this place." The man sits down next to a slain monster and leans against it like a beanbag chair. "I will stay here and make sure non of the bad monsters get you. And when you leave, I will catch up with you later." He rests his head on the monster like a cushion and takes a deep breath. "I'll just take a nap here. Don't try to wake me, ok? Even a guy like me needs his beauty sleep. Just go through the doors and don't look back. You will be able to find your family once you are out of here. Understand?" The girl nods and in return, the man smiles, gives one last chuckle, and falls "asleep". The poor, small girl couldn't be older than 10 years old. You can't just leave her here. You decide to find a way to escape with the young girl. Slowly opening the door, you take a step outside.

								This area seems to be in a giant cave with the ceiling being higher than a 14-floor building. The courtyard is surrounded by tall walls closing off this area from the outside. You see a gazebo and some overgrown hedges. This place must've been a beautiful garden before it came to ruin. There are bioluminescent plants on the ceiling of the cave that gives a soft light sky-blue hue to the place. The small girl turns around startled and gasps. She sees you and fear clouds her expression. You stop and realize that as a skeleton you must be a very frighting site to see. Even if your bandage rags only expose your head. You think about how you should approach the girl so that she doesn't see you as a threat. You know you can't talk so what do you do to convey you are friendly?

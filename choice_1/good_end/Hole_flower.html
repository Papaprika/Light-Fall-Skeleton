					<h1>
						You Make A Flower Crown
					</h1>

							<p> 
								Nonverbal communication is best in this situation. It can transcend any language barrier you might have with her since you don't know where you are. Since you are already in a castle. Why not make her its princess with a flower crown? You carefully set your torch down and step to the left of the entrance as the girl cautiously watches your every move. You suspect that she doesn't want to make any sudden movements for fear you might attack. Thankfully, the castle's previous botanist put a flower bed on both sides of the entrance to the courtroom. You pick some flowers and do your darnedest to weave them into a circular ring. You don't know how big you should make it so you just guess. And soon you make a very <i>shabby looking flower crown!</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								You crouch down and hold it out with both hands toward the small girl while staying still. You hope that doing so will make you less intimidating or less threatening. She seems to be a brave person because she approaches you with more curiosity than fear. When she gets close enough you put the crown gently on her head. She smiles and lets out a silent chuckle as the tension leaves her body. As a "thank you" she pets your head. You wonder if she is trying to be quiet for the "sleeping" man's sake.
							</p>

							<p>
								You point to the girl and tilt your head to the side questioningly, trying your best to pantomime "what is your name?" She seems to understand and takes out a piece of paper from her dress pocket, walks over, and hands it to you. It reads "Hi, my name is Lilian!" In very child-like scribble. She takes the paper back and flips it for you. There are some words that read " I can't talk! But, I understand you!" It appears that the small child <i>is mute!</i> You nod your head in understanding. You couldn't imagine what that must be like. But at least it looks like she speaks english. You reach out your hand, gesturing for Lilian to take it. And she does! Nice to know your idea worked. You take your torch in your other hand and lead her back into the courtroom to explore that other door. 
							</p>
							
							<p><b><i> You successfully calmed the girl down.</i></b> </p>

							<p>
								You take Lilian to the door you saw earlier hoping it has the way out of here. While walking you make sure to properly light both your paths avoiding any rocks, or stones so neither of you stubs your toe. You try to walk at a slow pace for Lilian so she doesn't get any more exhausted than she already is. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Once you get to the door you examine it. It just now occurs to you that this thing <i>could be locked.</i> You pray to your lucky stars that it isn't and try to open it. The door swings open like it's lighter than air. At first, it doesn't budge, but you give it a few more attempts. Just as you are about to give up you hear a click and the door swings open like it's lighter than air. Hmm... strange, it's like it <i>opened itself</i> for you. You make your way past the door with Lilian in tow. It leads to a short narrow hallway that opens into a room. The room has a comfortable-looking chair, which Lilian walks over and sits in while you inspect the rest of the room. There is a wide table adorned with various objects. There are bookshelves around the room filled with what you would expect a bookshelf to shelter. It seems whoever spent their time here was a bibliophile because there aren't enough bookshelves to hold all the books here! Some are scattered about the place, some are stacked into piles, and others are used as a bench for more books. Surely, this must be a fire hazard. You found a spot on the wall to place your torch while you inspected the room. Convenient! You temporarily seat your light buddy on the wall and make your way to the table. There is a map spread out on the table, an ink bottle, a quill, a lot of paper and notes, and some other things you don't recognize. Nothing on this map looks familiar to you. This and the monsters from earlier confirm it. You are not on Earth anymore. <i>Under the notes you notice a key!</i> You take it and read the note next to it.
							</p>

							<p>
								"Your highness, if you ever get the chance to read this I'm sorry things ended this way. Hopefully, we will meet again in another life but I must stay behind and keep those savages at bay. Whenever, or <i>"IF"</i> ever, you return then you should be able to use this key in the mouth of the Koi to escape this place. May the night cover you and the day blind your enemies. Be in peace my lordship."

								<i>THE KOI!</i> You remember that fountain with the Koi statue! You thought it was broken but apparently, it's just a keyhole for a secret path out of here! Now you and Lilian can escape! 
							</p>

							<p>
								You grab your handy-dandy torch stick and gesture for Lilian to follow you as you make your way back to the room you woke up in. Once there you insert the key into the mouth of the Koi statue and twist. With a "CLuNcK" sound a path opens up to the right of the Koi fountain. Looking at the small girl with her flower crown standing next to you, you swear to yourself that you will find her family and keep her safe until you do so. With Lilian's hand in yours you walk down the long corridor and escape!

					<h1> The Room East Of The Throne </h1>


					<p> 
						You decide it would be more practical to try and enter the room to the east instead of troubling yourself with whatever is outside to the north. You make your way over to the door, making sure to use your torch to light up your path and avoid tripping on rocks or stubbing your skeley-toes on stones. You get to the door and examine it. It just now occurs to you that this thing <i>could be locked.</i> You pray to your "daily calcium intake" that isn't the case and try to open it. At first, it doesn't budge, but you put your "boney back" into it and give it a few more attempts. Just as you are about to give up you hear a click and the door swings open like it's lighter than air. Hmm... strange, you thought maybe it was because you are weaker as a skeleton. But the way it opened... It's like it <i>opened itself</i> for you. You decide to not dwell on the matter and make your way past the door. Past the door is a short narrow hallway that leads into a room. The room has a comfortable-looking chair and a wide table adorned with various objects. There are bookshelves around the room, filled with what you would expect a bookshelf to shelter. It seems whoever spent their time here was a bibliophile because there aren't enough bookshelves to hold all the books here! Some are scattered about the place, some are stacked into piles, and others are used as a bench for more books. Surely, this must be a fire hazard. There is a spot on the wall to place your torch while you inspect the room. Convenient! You temporarily seat your light buddy on the wall and make your way to the table. There is a map spread out on the table, an ink bottle, a quill, a lot of paper and notes, and some other things you don't recognize. Nothing on this map looks familiar to you. It doesn't seem like any place you have ever seen before. But then again, you were never really good at "GeoGuessr".  <i> Under the notes you notice a key!</i> You take it and read the note next to it.

					</p>

					<p>
						"Your highness, if you ever get the chance to read this I'm sorry things ended this way. Hopefully, we will meet again in another life but I must stay behind and keep those savages at bay. Whenever, or <i>"IF"</i> ever, you return then you should be able to use this key in the mouth of the Koi to escape this place. May the night cover you and the day blind your enemies. Be in peace my lordship."

						<i>THE KOI!</i> You remember that fountain with the Koi statue! You thought it was broken but apparently, it's just a keyhole for a secret path out of here! Now you can escape!

					</p>

					<p>
						You grab your handy-dandy torch stick and make your way back to the room you woke up in. Once there you insert the key into the mouth of the Koi statue and twist. With a "CLuNcK" sound a path opens up to the right of the Koi fountain. Knowing the truth about yourself, you make a promise. You will find out what happened to you and change your fate! You walk down the long corridor and escape!

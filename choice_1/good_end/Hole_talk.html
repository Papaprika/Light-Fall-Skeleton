					<h1>
						You Try To Talk
					</h1>

							<p> 
								You very much prefer a good chat. Maybe you could say something funny to lighten the mood a bit. Ah, you have the perfect thing to say! You open your mouth to talk but nothing comes out. That's weird... Why can't you say anything? You try again and again but nothing comes out. You touch your face. And for the first time, you realized what has happened to you. <b><i>YOU HAVE BECOME A SKELETON!</i></b> Thats why she was so afriad of you! You would scream in horror but nothing would come out. You panic and shake trying to think of what to do and why this happened to you. Despair drops you to your knees in defeat...
							</p>
							<p>
								You hang your head in sadness. You imagine that if you had eyes, tears would be flowing from them in a steady stream. You're about to give up all hope in trying to live a life even if you escape this place when suddenly, you feel a small hand pet the top of your cranium. You look up and see the small girl look sad while petting your head. When did she close the gap between you too? You didn't even notice her in your mental breakdown. Is she... trying to comfort you? She must've noticed your distress. What a very kind-hearted soul. You can't let yourself fall apart while this child needs your help. With a new unshakable resolve, you stand back up and pat the girl's head as a "thank you" in return. 
							</p>

							<p>
								You point to the girl and tilt your head to the side questioningly, trying your best to pantomime "what is your name?" She seems to understand and takes out a piece of paper from her dress pocket, walks over, and hands it to you. It reads "Hi, my name is Lilian!" In very child-like scribble. She takes the paper back and flips it for you. There are some words that read " I can't talk! But, I understand you!" It appears that the small child <i>is mute! </i> You nod your head in understanding. It appears that you two are in the same boat. You reach out your hand, gesturing for Lilian to take it. And she does! Nice to know that she trusts you now. You take your torch in your other hand and lead her back into the courtroom to explore that other door. 
							</p>
							
							<p><i><b>You successfully calmed the girl down.</b></i></p>

							<p>
								You take Lilian to the door you saw earlier hoping it has the way out of here. While walking you make sure to properly light both your paths avoiding any rocks, or stones so neither of you stubs your toe. You try to walk at a slow pace for Lilian so she doesn't get any more exhausted than she already is. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Once you get to the door you examine it. It just now occurs to you that this thing <i>could be locked.</i> You pray to your wishing bone that it isn't and try to open it. The door swings open like it's lighter than air. It practically <i>opened itself</i> for you. Lucky! You make your way past the door with Lilian in tow. Past the door is a short narrow hallway that leads into a room. The room has a comfortable-looking chair, which Lilian walks over and sits in while you inspect the rest of the room. There is a wide table adorned with various objects. There are bookshelves around the room filled with what you would expect a bookshelf to shelter. It seems whoever spent their time here was a bibliophile because there aren't enough bookshelves to hold all the books here! Some are scattered about the place, some are stacked into piles, and others are used as a bench for more books. Surely, this must be a fire hazard. You found a spot on the wall to place your torch while you inspected the room. Convenient! You temporarily seat your light buddy on the wall and make your way to the table. There is a map spread out on the table, an ink bottle, a quill, a lot of paper and notes, and some other things you don't recognize. Nothing on this map looks familiar to you. It doesn't seem like any place you have ever seen before. This and the monsters from earlier confirm it. You are not on Earth anymore. <i>Under the notes you notice a key!</i> You take it and read the note next to it.

								"Your highness, if you ever get the chance to read this I'm sorry things ended this way. Hopefully, we will meet again in another life but I must stay behind and keep those savages at bay. Whenever, or <i>"IF"</i> ever, you return then you should be able to use this key in the mouth of the Koi to escape this place. May the night cover you and the day blind your enemies. Be in peace my lordship."

								<i>THE KOI!</i> You remember that fountain with the Koi statue! You thought it was broken but apparently, it's just a keyhole for a secret path out of here! Now you and Lilian can escape! 
							</p>

							<p>
								You grab your handy-dandy torch stick and gesture for Lilian to follow you as you make your way back to the room you woke up in. Once there you insert the key into the mouth of the Koi statue and twist. With a "CLuNcK" sound a path opens up to the right of the Koi fountain. Looking at the small girl next to you, you swear to yourself that you will find her family and keep her safe until you do so. With Lilian's hand in yours you walk down the long corridor and escape!

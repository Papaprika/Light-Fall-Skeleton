			<h1>You Exit The Room</h1>

			<p>
				You decide to duck through the hole and exit this room without checking the water. The crawl space isn't that long and soon leads to, what you guess, used to be an old castle courtroom. A beautiful open space is displayed before you in striking contrast to your previous claustrophobic confining. It looks like no one has been here for a long time as the pillars on both sides of the torn-up red carpet that lead to the throne chair in front of you seem crumbled, along with the windows, and some of the grand walls.  Wild fauna covers the room in blooming flowers and herbs as they have grown unhindered, and in the process decorate the fading ruins. A soft light illuminates the courtroom around you from the windows that spread out evenly across the upper walls. They are all relatively small windows compared to the gigantic stained glass window behind the throne and you. The majestic window covers the nearby area in a beautiful light, and you quietly wish you'd awoken here instead of in that small, dank room.

				Suddenly, you hear a commotion. It appears to be coming from behind the double oak doors north of you that are twice your size. You could go investigate it. Maybe someone could use your help? Maybe you could ask for help yourself? You are kind of lost right now. However, there is a chance the commotion isn't a good one. It could very well be the kidnappers that brought you here in the first place.  As you ponder this, you spot a room tucked away between two pillars directly to the east of the throne and you. It's the only other exit here. Maybe it was some kind of staff room from when this place was still a castle. You could avoid whatever is to the north and go through this door instead to find a way out of this place.

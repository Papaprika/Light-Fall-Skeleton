						Used The Torch: Bad End
					</h1>

<p>
	You take whatever constitutes a deep breath for a skeleton and put the flame towards your bandage-like rags. The flame catches quickly, but unfortunately so does the pain. You are filled with sorrow and regret for not believing this could be real. You'll never know how this even happen and the knowledge of that kills you more than the flame does. You feel that it was unfair that this is your fate as the flames of your soul end before the one you started does.

	  Fun Fact: In most RPGs Skeletons are <i>weak</i> to blunt attacks and fire. And your stick torch would count as a <i>blunt</i> weapon and <i>fire</i> weapon. So you did double damage... to yourself? Oops!
